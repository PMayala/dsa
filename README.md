# Unique Integers Assignment

This repository contains a Python solution for the Unique Integers assignment, a task commonly encountered in Enterprise Web Development courses. The assignment requires reading a list of integers from an input file and generating an output file containing sorted unique integers, adhering to specific formatting rules.

## Features

- **Input Handling:** Reads integers from input files with support for various formats.
- **Unique Integer Generation:** Generates output files with sorted unique integers.
- **File Organization:** Organizes code and sample data according to assignment guidelines.
- **Documentation:** Provides internal documentation within the code for clarity and understanding.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script `UniqueInt.py`, providing appropriate input and output file paths as arguments.

Example:
```bash
python UniqueInt.py input.txt output.txt
